Analyzes 2020 Presidential Election Data from New York Times and creates precinct maps. The data is described at https://github.com/TheUpshot/presidential-precinct-map-2020 . That description includes the following link to the data:

**The GeoJSON dataset can be downloaded at: https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/elections/map-data/2020/national/precincts-with-results.geojson.gz .**

That dataset must be downloaded and unzipped to create a file named precincts-with-results.geojson. That file must be placed in a directory of the same name (precincts-with-results.geojson) to be read by the application.
